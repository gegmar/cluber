## About Cluber

Cluber shall provide as a first use case a simple user interface to sell online tickets for the events organized by the clubs. The software builds on the popular Laravel project and aims to run on all conventional webhosters that provide PHP-Webspace and databases.

## Goals for future development

On the long run the tool shall not only provide online tickets but should also host tools for sending newsletters, use an interface build on Angular (not on the quick-n-dirty static views) and a comprehensive admin interface.

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Laravel, please send an e-mail to Martin via [martin@gegenleitner.eu](mailto:martin@gegenleitner.eu). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.
