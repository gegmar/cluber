## About Cluber

Cluber provides a simple user interface to sell online tickets for the events organized by the clubs. The software builds on the popular Laravel project and aims to run on all conventional webhosters that provide PHP-Webspace and databases.

For selling tickets the project uses Mollie.com as its primary payment provider. So make sure to have an (free) account there to test transactions.
